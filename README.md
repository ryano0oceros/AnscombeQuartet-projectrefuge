# AnscombeQuartet-projectrefuge
Project to ensure that the Go statistical package yields results comparable to those (estimated linear regression coefficients) obtained from Python and R

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the Anscombe Quartet in Go. The Anscombe Quartet is a set of four datasets that have nearly identical statistical properties, but are visually distinct. The goal of this project is to ensure that the Go statistical package yields results comparable to those (estimated linear regression coefficients) obtained from Python and R.

## Recommendation to Management

Based on the results of this project, we recommend considering Go for data science applications. Our tests show that the Go statistical package yields results identical to those obtained from Python and R, which are widely used in data science. Furthermore, Go's performance is impressive; in my tests, Go's runtime was significantly faster than Python's (on the order of microseconds vs. seconds, although the python example had more functionality built in). In summary, I recommend using Go for data science applications where performance is critical and the necessary functionality is not too specialized. For more specialized data science tasks, Python or R might be more suitable.

### Caveats and Considerations
There are a few considerations to keep in mind. While Go has robust support for many general programming tasks, its data science ecosystem is not as mature as Python's or R's. Python and R have a vast array of libraries and tools specifically designed for data science, which Go currently lacks. This means that data scientists might have to implement some functionality from scratch, which could be time-consuming. Additionally, Go's syntax and paradigms are different from those of Python and R, which are more familiar to most data scientists. This could lead to a steeper learning curve for data scientists new to Go.

# Automated Code Generation

## AI-assisted programming

### main.go

When asking for GitHub Copilot to suggest improvements to this code, it returned the following:

"The current code is already quite clean and efficient. However, if you want to improve readability and maintainability, you could consider extracting the anonymous function into a named function. This can make the code easier to understand, especially if the function becomes more complex in the future. Here's how you can do it:

```go
func calculateRegressionForDataSet1() {
    calculateRegressionCoefficients(dataSet1)
}

measureExecutionTime(calculateRegressionForDataSet1, "LinearRegression for dataSet1")
```

In this code, `calculateRegressionForDataSet1` is a new function that calls `calculateRegressionCoefficients` with `dataSet1`. This function is then passed to `measureExecutionTime`.

This change doesn't affect the functionality of the code, but it can make the code easier to understand and maintain."

## main_test.go

When asking for GitHub Copilot to suggest improvements to existing unit tests, it returned the following:

"Looking at the provided code, it seems like you're benchmarking the `stats.LinearRegression` function with two different datasets. Here are a few suggestions to improve your tests:

1. **Use table-driven tests**: Instead of writing separate functions for each dataset, you can use a table-driven test. This will make your code more concise and easier to extend with new datasets.

2. **Reset the timer**: In benchmark tests, you should call b.ResetTimer() before the loop that contains the code to be benchmarked. This is to ensure that the setup code (like creating the datasets) is not included in the time measurement.

Here's how you can apply these suggestions:

```go
package main

import (
    "testing"

    "github.com/montanaflynn/stats"
)

func BenchmarkLinearRegression(b *testing.B) {
    dataSets := []struct {
        name string
        data []stats.Coordinate
    }{
        {
            name: "dataSet1",
            data: []stats.Coordinate{
                {X: 10, Y: 8.04},
                {X: 8, Y: 6.95},
                {X: 13, Y: 7.58},
                {X: 9, Y: 8.81},
                {X: 11, Y: 8.33},
                {X: 14, Y: 9.96},
                {X: 6, Y: 7.24},
                {X: 4, Y: 4.26},
                {X: 12, Y: 10.84},
                {X: 7, Y: 4.82},
                {X: 5, Y: 5.68},
            },
        },
        // Add dataSet2, dataSet3, etc. here...
    }

    for _, tt := range dataSets {
        b.Run(tt.name, func(b *testing.B) {
            b.ResetTimer()
            for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
                _, _ = stats.LinearRegression(tt.data)
            }
        })
    }
}
```
In this code, `BenchmarkLinearRegression` is a table-driven test that benchmarks the `stats.LinearRegression` function with multiple datasets. The `b.Run` function is used to create a sub-benchmark for each dataset."

## AI-Generated Code

### main.go

When asking for ChatGPT to suggest improvements to this code, it returned the following:

"The code you provided has some areas that could be improved for better readability, performance, and maintainability. Here's a refined version of the code with explanations for the changes made:

1. **Remove Redundant Calculation**: The calculateRegressionCoefficients function recalculates the slope and intercept even after stats.LinearRegression has already calculated them. This redundancy can be removed to simplify the function and improve performance.
2. **Error Handling**: The original code doesn't properly handle or report errors from the stats.LinearRegression function.
3. **Reduce Code Duplication**: You are repeating similar lines of code for different datasets. This can be simplified using a loop.
4. **Clarify Function Names and Purpose**: Naming functions clearly can make the code more understandable.
Here's an improved version of your code:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/montanaflynn/stats"
)

func main() {
	dataSets := [][]stats.Coordinate{
		{
			{X: 10, Y: 8.04}, {X: 8, Y: 6.95}, {X: 13, Y: 7.58}, {X: 9, Y: 8.81},
			{X: 11, Y: 8.33}, {X: 14, Y: 9.96}, {X: 6, Y: 7.24}, {X: 4, Y: 4.26},
			{X: 12, Y: 10.84}, {X: 7, Y: 4.82}, {X: 5, Y: 5.68},
		},
		// Repeat for other datasets...
	}

	// Process each dataset
	for i, dataSet := range dataSets {
		label := fmt.Sprintf("LinearRegression for dataSet%d", i+1)
		measureExecutionTime(func() { displayRegressionCoefficients(dataSet) }, label)
	}
}

func displayRegressionCoefficients(dataSet []stats.Coordinate) {
	slope, intercept, err := calculateRegressionCoefficients(dataSet)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error calculating coefficients: %v\n", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("Slope: %f, Intercept: %f\n", slope, intercept)
}

func calculateRegressionCoefficients(dataSet []stats.Coordinate) (float64, float64, error) {
	slope, intercept, err := stats.LinearRegression(dataSet)
	if err != nil {
		return 0, 0, err
	}
	return slope, intercept, nil
}

func measureExecutionTime(f func(), label string) {
	start := time.Now()
	f()
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("%s took %s\n", label, elapsed)
}
```

Changes Explained:

- **Consolidated Data Initialization**: By using a slice of slices, initialization is more structured and less repetitive.
- **Loop Over DataSets**: This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to scale or modify the code for additional datasets.
- **Improved Function Naming and Separation of Concerns**: `displayRegressionCoefficients` handles the output, while `calculateRegressionCoefficients` focuses strictly on calculating values.

This code is cleaner and more maintainable, making it easier to adapt or expand in the future.


## Summary of Experience with Automated Programming

After running my code through GitHub Copilot Chat, I was confident in the initial quality of my code/deliverable for this assignment. It validated that my code was clean & efficient and only suggested a minor change. However when I ran my code through ChatGPT, it suggested more significant changes to my code. It suggested that I remove redundant calculations, add error handling, reduce code duplication, and clarify function names and purpose. I found this to be very helpful as it provided me with a different perspective on my code and how I could improve it. I believe that using AI-assisted programming tools can be very beneficial in improving code quality and efficiency - if prompted correctly. It can help developers catch errors, improve readability, and suggest better ways to implement code. I will definitely consider using these tools in the future to improve my code and learn new ways to write better code.

### What are the possibilities for reducing the programming workload in the startup? 
As a relatively inexperienced Go developer, I would recommend using AI-assisted programming tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to reduce the programming workload in the startup. Using these types of tools, especially from the beginning, would have gotten me to a closer to complete solution more quickly in the context of this assignment. They can also help developers learn new ways to write better code and improve code quality and efficiency. By using these tools, the startup can reduce the time and effort required to write code, allowing developers to focus on more critical tasks and projects. These types of tools could also help collaborate across languages/environments as someone who comes from, say, a Python or Javascript background could prompt these tools to explain the code in a way that is more familiar to them and even deliver in a different target language. However, this doesn't fully replace the need for human programmers, as they are still needed to understand the business requirements, design the architecture, and ensure the quality of the code. These types of AI tools often return errors that need to be fixed by a human, so they are best used as a complement to human programmers. 

(As a note, I'm curious to see how this evolves as the tools get better and better. As a GitHub engineer I receive early access to tools such as GitHub Copilot Workspace which is daunting in its capabilities as it can handle more complex requirements and multiple step problems from sprint design to execution.)

### What is your recommendation to the firm regarding its staffing of programmers and software engineers? 

I recommend a balanced approach that leverages automation tools like GitHub Copilot to enhance productivity without drastically reducing the number of programmers. While these tools can significantly aid in coding, they are not replacements for the creative problem-solving and strategic thinking provided by human engineers. Instead of cutting staff, focus on retraining your team to use these tools effectively, which can increase output and reduce bugs without compromising on innovation or quality. This strategy will likely yield better long-term value than merely reducing headcount, as it maintains your firm's capacity for growth and adaptation.
